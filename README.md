README for patternfly-java
==========================

Setting up PatternFly v1.1.0 with a traditional webapp with Spring Boot and Freemarker.

When you go execute :

  > mvv spring-boot:run

You go to :

  > http://localhost:8080/

You see a page from PatternFly "basic.html" but with data populated from backend / controller.
